Come to the OpenMR Benelux 2020! 

Like many other fields, MRI research profits greatly from the collaboration between researchers, developers and industry. <br /> <br />
In the OpenMR Benelux 2020, we want to demonstrate how an increasingly open network can help us create innovative solutions to problems we face. <br />

With a wide range of topics, our goal is to welcome attendees from technical or clinical backgrounds, and discuss topics related to open science practices in magnetic resonance imaging, including open tools for machine learning applications in MRI, data and code sharing practices, the role of mentoring in facilitating academic careers and the future of open access publishing.
