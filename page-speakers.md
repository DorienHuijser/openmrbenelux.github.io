  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Marjan Bakker is an assistant professor at the Methods and Statistics Department at Tilburg University. She is part of the Meta-Research Center in Tilburg at which they study the scientific system in psychology; in general to find its flaws and empirically test potential solutions. She wants to improve science by investigating problems and possible solutions. Her interests consist of reporting errors, the use of questionable research practices, statistical power, outliers in data, publication bias, and preregistration. Currently, she is mainly working on some larger projects on preregistration and on a project to replicate Mahoney’s seminal study on publication bias (for which she got an NWO replication grant).</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Cass is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry. She provides support for (f)MRI experimental design and analysis in the investigation of treatments for mood disorders. In this role, she has to stay up to speed with the leading edge of analytic tools, and is constantly on the lookout for tips, tricks, and techniques to make this research quicker, slicker, and more effective. This goes hand-in-hand with making the research more transparent and reproducible, and freely sharing the outputs of our labour. She is a contributor to <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction">The Turing Way</a> and works with the <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/open-neuroimaging/open-neuroimaging-project">Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging Open Community Team</a>. She is a passionate believer in accessibility and the equitable dissemination of knowledge, and spends a lot of time showing people that programming isn’t scary.</p>

He is responsible for the management of three clinical MRs and one research system. Next to his clinical work, he is involved in various research projects, both in Ghent and internationally, on functional and structural imaging in multiple organs and body parts. Pim is co-lead of the Reproducibility and Standardisation workgroup of COST Action PARENCHIMA (CA16103) on the development of renal MRI biomarkers. After his initial training as biomedical engineer in medical image processing and biomedical NMR, Pim has worked both in industry (start-up and small business) and in academia. His main interests are functional and quantitative imaging of the brain and kidneys, standardisation of MR imaging, and validation/quality assurance in MRI.</p>

Open-source invaded his heart when he realized that he did not need to spend 1 year implementing an algorithm because someone kind went the extra mile and publish a well documented open-source tool that others can use to their purposes. João is also involved in the project: Opensourceimaging.org (OSI²), a creative community of volunteers with the aim of facilitate medical devices to more people all around the world.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Daniele Marinazzo is an associate professor in the Department of Data Analysis of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University. His team focuses on methodological and computational aspects of neuroscience research, and on the dynamical networks subserving function, as well as thorough statistical validation of the results. They develop new techniques for inferring connectivity architectures from the dynamics of the recorded data, in challenging cases of short, noisy and redundant time series, as those encountered in neuroimaging. Daniele cares about open science and ways to improve the review/editorial process. He is an editor at several journals in his field, including PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS One, NeuroImage, Brain Topography, Network Neuroscience.

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Fatma Deniz is currently a Visiting Scientist at TU Berlin and a PostDoc at the Gallant Lab in UC Berkeley. Prior to her current position, Fatma was a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a fellow at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. She is interested in how linguistic information is encoded in the brain and uses machine-learning approaches to fit computational models to large-scale brain data. Her current work focuses on cross-modal language representation in the human brain. She did her PhD at Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where she studied functional connectivity changes during conscious perception in humans and got a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Science from the Technical University Munich. During her master’s work, Dr. Deniz worked with Dr. Christof Koch at Caltech, where she studied visual saliency and automated text detection. As an advocate of reproducible research practices, she is the editor of the book titled “The Practice of Reproducible Research”. In addition, she works on improving Internet security applications using the knowledge gained from cognitive neuroscience and Mooney images (mooneyauth.org). Her work is at the intersection between computer science, human cognition, and neuroscience. She is a passionate coder, baker, and loves to play the cello.</p>

Furthermore, Robert is interested in improving the methodological aspects of cognitive neuroimaging at the meta level: he contributes to the dissemination of state-of-the-art analysis methods by developing open-source software, by data sharing and by organizing educational and scientific workshops.

His contributions to the methodological advancement of the field of non-invasive electrophysiology are exemplified by FieldTrip, a project that he started about 10 years ago and that he has been heading since. To strengthen the MEG and EEG research community, Robert is not managing FieldTrip only as a data analysis toolbox, but also as a platform for the exchange of ideas and expertise.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Tim van Mourik is a PostDoc at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis tools to analyse fMRI scans at an even finer level of detail: that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals, but also applications to build graphical pipelines with these tools (<a href="https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/">Porcupine</a>). In addition, he set up web applications to facilitate sharing fMRI results in augmented reality (<a href="https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com">ARmadillo</a>) and improved collaboration on interactive workflows (<a href="https://giraffe.tools">GiraffeTools</a>). At the OHBM conference 2019, Tim was the chair of the Open Science Room and in charge of organising a week long program with talks, discussions, and demos towards open and reproducible research practices.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Lyuba Zehl studied Biology and Neuroscience at the University of Cologne. During this time of study, she worked on kinematic of insect legs during locomotion (BSc thesis, supervisor: Prof. Ansgar Büschges), and the anatomical cartography of auditory nuclei in the brain stem of toothed whales using cluster analysis (Msc thesis, supervisor: Prof. Wolfgang Walkowiak). For her doctoral studies, she switched to the RWTH Aachen University and joined the Statistical Neuroscience Group of Prof. Sonja Grün at the Institute for Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) of the Jülich Research Centre. In her thesis, she worked on analysing multi-electrode array recordings of monkey motor cortex and, in particular, on data and metadata management of complex neuroscience experiments. After receiving her doctorate degree (Dr. rer. nat.) in 2017, she started working as a junior scientist in the curation team of the Neuroinformatics Platform of the Human Brain Project (HBP), located at the Jülich Research Centre as part of the Big Data Analytics Group from Timo Dickscheid at the Institute for Structural and Functional Organisation of the Brain (INM-1) led by Prof. Katrin Amunts. Having a high interdisciplinary orientation towards computational neuroscience and software development for data and metadata management and a broad experience in various neuroscience laboratories, she focuses now on developing and implementing concepts, standards and tools for neuroscience data and metadata management. With her current work, she strongly supports the integration of heterogeneous neuroscience data into the unified data sharing platform and the interactive atlas viewers of the HBP. </p>
