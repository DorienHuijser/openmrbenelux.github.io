<p> Amongst a lot more information about Nijmegen, the <b><a href="https://en.visitnijmegen.com/traveller-information/getting-here" style="color:#004777">rijkvannijmegen.com</a></b>, the website of the official tourist office of Nijmegen, has very clear information on getting here! Check some of the tips below:
    
<div style="color:#000000">
<br>
<div class="padding" style="text-align: left;">To travel by public transport in the Netherlands, you need a ticket known as an OV-Chipkaart. You can buy an <b>OV-Chipkaart</b> with a starting price of €7.50 from ticket machines at larger railway stations, from newsagents and a large number of supermarkets in the Netherlands.</div>
<br>
<div class="padding" style="text-align: left;">It’s also possible to buy a slightly more expensive <b>single-use day ticket</b> from the ticket machines at NS railway stations.</div>
<br>
<div class="padding" style="text-align: left;">Before you get on the train, you need to check in at the station/on the platform by holding your ticket against one of the card-readers.</div>
<br>
<div class="padding" style="text-align: left;">Remember! You also need to check out again at one of the card-readers when you arrive at your destination. If you are travelling by bus, tram or metro, <b>you should check in and out as you get on and off</b>.</div>
