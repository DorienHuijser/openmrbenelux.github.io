Interested in an open world, where ideas and tools are shared and collaboration-based development is standard in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) community?

Us too! And that is what the OpenMR Benelux is all about. Let’s open up this discussion!

[**Registration**](./page-registration.md) **is open!**

We invite you to join us and a team of amazing MRI researchers and developers to learn, speak up, develop, and discuss open (MRI) science practices!

## <span style="color:#004777"> Who are we? </span>  

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/ext_images/side-column-team.jpg" width="390" height="80"> 

We are a community of students, research faculty and professionals who want to create an open forum for people working in MRI research to learn about and discuss open science practices.

We focus on working together on implementable solutions in all forms: software toolboxes, process descriptions, community projects, knowledge-sharing initiatives and more. Open discussion is central to our event and we foster open-minded attitudes and a readiness to participate. Interested in joining? See our next event! Want to see the people working hard in the background to make this a success? Meet the [Team](./page-team)!

The first edition of OpenMR Benelux in 2019 was a blast! You can check out last year’s program, speakers and more at [OpenMR Benelux 2019](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/openmrb2019/).
