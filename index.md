Are you working or studying at a university in Belgium, The Netherlands, or Luxembourg in the field of magnetic resonance in medicine? Interested in learning about open science practices and tools and how to apply them in your research? Want to meet like minded students and researchers, discuss challenges and ideas and start new collaborations? If you answered yes to any of these questions, join us for our annual [OpenMR Seminar 2020](./page-openmrb-2020) event on 21-23 January 2020 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands

## Who are we?

We are a community of students, research faculty and professionals who want to create an open forum for people working in MRI research to learn about and discuss open science practices.

We focus on working together on implementable solutions in all forms: software toolboxes, process descriptions, community projects, knowledge-sharing initiatives and more. Open discussion is central to our events and we foster open minded attitudes and a readiness to participate. Interested in joining? See our next event! Want to see the people working hard in the background to make this a success? Meet the [Team](./page-team)!

The first edition of OpenMR Benelux in 2019 was a blast! You can check out last yearâ€™s program, speakers and more at [OpenMR Benelux 2019](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/openmrb2019/).
