<!-- <p><div style="text-align: justify"><b>Enforcement</b></div></p> -->
<p><div style="text-align: justify">Participants asked by the event organisers to stop any harassing behavior are required to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organisers retain the right to take any necessary actions to keep the OpenMR Benelux event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event. Organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.</div></p>
<p><div style="text-align: justify">Additionally, participants asked by another attendee to stop any behavior perceived as harassing, threatening, or otherwise unpleasant are expected to comply within reasonable limits. If a participant considers such a request unreasonable they may raise the issue with the inclusiveness committee.</div></p>

<h2 style="color:#004777"> Reporting </h2>
<!-- <p><div style="text-align: justify"><b>Reporting</b></div></p> -->

<p><div style="text-align: justify">Harassment or non-inclusive behavior is defined by you. So, do not hesitate to report something because someone else thinks the behavior is "reasonable". That person may not share your protected characteristic(s).</div></p>
