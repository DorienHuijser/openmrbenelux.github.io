                    <br />Daniele Marinazzo is an associate professor in the
                    Department of Data Analysis of the Faculty of Psychology and
                    Educational Sciences at Ghent University. His team focuses
                    on methodological and computational aspects of neuroscience
                    research, and on the dynamical networks subserving function,
                    as well as thorough statistical validation of the results.
                    They develop new techniques for inferring connectivity
                    architectures from the dynamics of the recorded data, in
                    challenging cases of short, noisy and redundant time series,
                    as those encountered in neuroimaging. Daniele cares about
                    open science and ways to improve the review/editorial
                    process. He is an editor at several journals in his field,
                    including PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS One, NeuroImage,
                    Brain Topography, Network Neuroscience. Visit Danieleâ€™s

                    for connectomics in the domain of cognitive neuroimaging,
                    i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research.

                    <br />Tim van Mourik is a PostDoc at the Donders Centre for
                    Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis
                    tools to analyse fMRI scans at an even finer level of
                    detail: that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not
                    only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals,
                    but also applications to build graphical pipelines with
                    these tools (<a

                    >). In addition, he set up web applications to facilitate
                    sharing fMRI results in augmented reality (<a
