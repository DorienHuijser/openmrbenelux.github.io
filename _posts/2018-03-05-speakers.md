#### Current and future scenarios for open scientific publishing and reviewing
**Abstract:** 
Communicating our research is a fundamental part of our work as scientists, and a duty towards the society. Typically this communication happens through articles published in scientific journals, after having been reviewed by our peers. We will discuss several aspects of scholarly communication and in particular of scientific publishing and peer review. Some of these aspects are (un-)surprisingly in clear contrast with the idea of science as an open and collaborative public mission. Several solutions and improvements have been proposed and sometimes implemented over the years, on some of them there's wide consensus, on others there is not. And even when there is consensus to change, the change is slow. We will explore the state of the art and different future perspectives, and discuss our experiences and expectations.

**Bio:**
Daniele is an associate professor in the department of Data Analysis of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University. His team focuses on methodological and computational aspects of neuroscience research, and on the dynamical networks subserving function, as well as thorough statistical validation of the results. They develop new techniques for inferring connectivity architectures from the dynamics of the recorded data, in challenging cases of short, noisy and redundant time series, as those encountered in neuroimaging. Daniele cares about open science and ways to improve the review/editorial process. He is an editor at several journals in his field, including PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS One,  NeuroImage, Brain Topography, Network Neuroscience.

#### How I Fail in Open Science
**Abstract:**
More detail to follow soon!

**Bio:**
Veronika is an assistant professor at the Medical Image Analysis group, Eindhoven University of Technology since February 2017. She received her Ph.D. from the Delft University of Technology for her thesis Dissimilarity-Based Multiple Instance Learning in 2015. As part of her PhD, she was a visiting researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen, Germany. From 2015 to 2016 she was a postdoc at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam, Erasmus MC. Her research interests are centered around learning scenarios where few labels are available, such as multiple instance learning, transfer learning, and crowdsourcing. Next to research, Veronika blogs about academic life.

#### MR image reconstruction using open source software
**Abstract:** 
More detail to follow soon!

**Bio:**
Matthan's research is on rapid and comprehensive MRI in the human brain. He is currently working on quantitative MRI at high field, diffusion MRI and deep learning for image reconstruction, and is applying these methods in brain disease studies using machine learning.
