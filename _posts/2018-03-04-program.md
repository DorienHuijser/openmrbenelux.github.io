# Program

The morning welcome session and all talks will be presented in the same location (Collegezaal 3, Gebouw 1, LUMC), which is also where coffee and lunch will be served. 

Talks will be presented throughout the day, and interactive discussion is strongly encouraged. To get an idea for the topics that will be discussed, please have a look at the <strong><a href="#speakers">speaker abstracts</a><strong>.

The exact program will be released soon.
