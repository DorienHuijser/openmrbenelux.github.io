#### Current and future scenarios for open scientific publishing and reviewing
**Abstract:** 
More detail to follow soon!

**Bio:**
Daniele is an associate professor in the department of Data Analysis of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University. His team focuses on methodological and computational aspects of neuroscience research, and on the dynamical networks subserving function, as well as thorough statistical validation of the results. They develop new techniques for inferring connectivity architectures from the dynamics of the recorded data, in challenging cases of short, noisy and redundant time series, as those encountered in neuroimaging. Daniele cares about open science and ways to improve the review/editorial process. He is an editor at several journals in his field, including PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS One,  NeuroImage, Brain Topography, Network Neuroscience.

**Bio:**
Veronika is an assistant professor at the Medical Image Analysis group, Eindhoven University of Technology since February 2017. She received her Ph.D. from the Delft University of Technology for her thesis Dissimilarity-Based Multiple Instance Learning in 2015. As part of her PhD, she was a visiting researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen, Germany. From 2015 to 2016 she was a postdoc at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam, Erasmus MC. Her research interests are centered around learning scenarios where few labels are available, such as multiple instance learning, transfer learning, and crowdsourcing. Next to research, Veronika blogs about academic life.

**Bio:**
Natalia is finalizing her PhD project in the Donders Institute, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Her research interests circle around causal inference and signal detection, and developing new methods for data analysis in cognitive neuroimaging. She is also interested in the topic of mentoring in academia, and she currently holds a position of Career Development and Mentoring Manager in the Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping.

**Bio:**
Tim is a PostDoc at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour. He has developed tools for making laminar fMRI possible and is particularly interested in workflow development, open science, open source software, and good coding practices. Among others, he has created the [Porcupine](https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine) visual programming application and an Augmented Reality brain visualisation website, [ARmadillo](https://armadillobrain.app).

#### MR image reconstruction using open source software
**Abstract:** 
More detail to follow soon!

**Bio:**
Matthan's research is on rapid and comprehensive MRI in the human brain. He is currently working on quantitative MRI at high field, diffusion MRI and deep learning for image reconstruction, and is applying these methods in brain disease studies using machine learning.
