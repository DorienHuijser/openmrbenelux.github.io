# Registration for Brainhack Ghent 2018 is __NOW__ open!

**!! REGISTRATION DEADLINE: 1st of May !!**

On **7-8th May 2018**, the second edition of **Brainhack Ghent** will take place as part of the Brainhack Global event. During this two-day event dedicated to students and PhD students, we will work in teams on **neuroscience-related projects**. 

The aim of the event is to collaborate on projects, meet new researchers, make new friendships in academia, learn, share the knowledge on data mining and brain research, but also promote open science in the spirit of the whole Brainhack community [(Craddock et al., 2016)](https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13742-016-0121-x). Attendees  of various backgrounds are welcome to join!

By submitting your research project or contacting us about a tutorial you can gain a priceless leadership experience as you will  work with and manage a group of researchers at our two-day event.
