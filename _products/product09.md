Reproducibility in research is one of the main building blocks of the scientific method. However, there is rising concern about reproducibility in current scientific research that reduces the reliability of published findings in various domains. In this workshop, we will learn about the tools and practices that will help us to improve the reproducibility of our own research pipeline. Based on the book <a href="https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/">The Practice of Reproducible research</a>, I will first introduce reproducible research workflows by providing case-study examples. In the second part, participants will walk through their own research pipeline and create their own reproducible research workflow. In small working groups, participants will reflect on their own computational practices and learn how they can improve the reproducibility of their own research workflow.
