Marjan Bakker will build her talk around the replication crisis in science. She will show examples of p-hacking and will discuss the surprising fraction of confirmed hypotheses. This is not only a problem in psychology attested by examples of failure to replicate studies in other fields. She pleads for preregistration of hypothesis, study-design, and analysis plan to minimize the researcher’s degrees of freedom.
