Sharing GDPR Compliant Neuroimaging Research Data</b><br><br>Personal data privacy and research data sharing seem, on the surface, to be at odds. On the one hand the European General Data Protection Regulation provides important regulations for protecting personal information to a high standard, something that we should uphold in multiple facets of life. On the other hand, current principles of transparency and reproducibility in research (in short, open science) suggests that we should publicly share the data underlying our scientific findings. This leaves us with a conundrum: how do we protect the individual's privacy, while allowing others to access and process their data? In this talk I will provide an overview of what has been done at several EU institutions to enable neuroimaging data sharing under GDPR. We will also look at the progress made with a collaborative and open project that aims to provide open templates and resources for informed consent forms, data anonymization techniques, data usage agreements, and more.
