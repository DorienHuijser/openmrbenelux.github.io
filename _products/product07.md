Communicating our research is a fundamental part of our work as scientists, and a duty towards the society. Typically this communication happens through articles published in scientific journals, after having been reviewed by our peers. We will discuss several aspects of scholarly communication and in particular of scientific publishing and peer review. Some of these aspects are (un-)surprisingly in clear contrast with the idea of science as an open and collaborative public mission. Several solutions and improvements have been proposed and sometimes implemented over the years; on some of them thereâ€™s wide consensus, on others there is not. And even when there is consensus to change, the change is slow. We will explore the state of the art and different future perspectives, and discuss our experiences and expectations.
