Across the past years, many developments arose in connectivity analyses based on MRI data offering now a wide range of connectivity markers. Capitalizing on this wealth of neuroimaging markers, connectivity-based parcellation can be used to unravel the complexity of brain organization. Furthermore, large population-based neuroimaging datasets with extensive psychometric characterization now open promising perspectives to link brain organization to behavior. In particular, interindividual variability in brainâ€™s region functional connectivity can be related to interindividual variability in psychometric data by using a connectivity-based psychometric prediction approach. Despite some challenges associated to the use of these data-driven approaches, they also offer opportunities to better understand the relationships between brain connectivity and human behavior.
