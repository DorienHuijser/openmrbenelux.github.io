How do we share and communicate our analysis pathways? By means of a text-description in a paper, or are there other ways? In this day and age where everything happens online, it should be possible to leverage web technologies for neuroimaging. Indeed, there is a growing number of web tools to share and communicate project information, data sets, and entire interactive workflows online. In this talk I will discuss a variety of these projects, how to get started or even involved in them, and what I believe is the future of data analysis and neuroimaging.
