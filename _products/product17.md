MR Image Registration with Elastix and Simple Elastix</b><br><br>From multi-modality superpositioning to atlas alignment, image registration plays a central role in medical image analysis. In this talk/workshop, Stefan will give us insights on how Elastix and Simple Elastix work, applicable modalities and how to profit the most from this amazing tool. During the workshop, a hands-on guided practical session will demonstrate how versatile Elastix is, even in novel fields, such as quantitative MRI.
