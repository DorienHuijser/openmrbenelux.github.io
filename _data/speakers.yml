      bio: Marjan Bakker is an assistant professor at the Methods
        and Statistics Department at Tilburg University. She is part
        of the Meta-Research Center in Tilburg at which they study
        the scientific system in psychology; in general to find its
        flaws and empirically test potential solutions. She wants to
        improve science by investigating problems and possible
        solutions. Her interests consist of reporting errors, the
        use of questionable research practices, statistical power,
        outliers in data, publication bias, and preregistration.
        Currently, she is mainly working on some larger projects on
        preregistration and on a project to replicate Mahoney’s
        seminal study on publication bias (for which she got an NWO
        replication grant).
      abstract:
        title: Diving Into Metascience – Doing Research on Research
        content: Marjan Bakker will build her talk around the
          replication crisis in science. She will show examples of
          p-hacking and will discuss the surprising fraction of
          confirmed hypotheses. This is not only a problem in
          psychology attested by examples of failure to replicate
          studies in other fields. She pleads for preregistration of
          hypothesis, study-design, and analysis plan to minimize the
          researcher’s degrees of freedom

      bio: Cass is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
        Oxford Department of Psychiatry. She provides support for
        (f)MRI experimental design and analysis in the investigation
        of treatments for mood disorders. In this role, she has to
        stay up to speed with the leading edge of analytic tools,
        and is constantly on the lookout for tips, tricks, and
        techniques to make this research quicker, slicker, and more
        effective. This goes hand-in-hand with making the research
        more transparent and reproducible, and freely sharing the
        outputs of our labour. She is a contributor to
        <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction">The Turing Way</a>
        and works with the
        <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/open-neuroimaging/open-neuroimaging-project">
        Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging Open
        Community Team </a>. She is a passionate believer in accessibility and the
        equitable dissemination of knowledge, and spends a lot of
        time showing people that programming isn’t scary.

        title: Analytical Flexibility and Questionable Research Practices in MRI
        content: The number of methods available for MRI
          analysis is growing every year. Each of these methods
          requires the specification of a bewildering array of
          parameters, not all of which are amenable to optimisation by
          consensus. The combination of these factors leads to an
          almost infinite number of ways in which we may analyse our
          data, and accordingly an infinite number of results which we
          may choose to report, or not. In this talk, I will discuss
          concerns of such analytic flexibility and the draw of
          questionable research practices to help uncover the
          "publishable story" in our data. I will present recent
          developments in our discipline which may assist the
          identification of robust effects, and what individual
          actions we may take in order to retain confidence in our own
          findings.
