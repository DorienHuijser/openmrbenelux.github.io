      bio: Marjan Bakker is an assistant professor at the Methods
        and Statistics Department at Tilburg University. She is part
        of the Meta-Research Center in Tilburg at which they study
        the scientific system in psychology; in general to find its
        flaws and empirically test potential solutions. She wants to
        improve science by investigating problems and possible
        solutions. Her interests consist of reporting errors, the
        use of questionable research practices, statistical power,
        outliers in data, publication bias, and preregistration.
        Currently, she is mainly working on some larger projects on
        preregistration and on a project to replicate Mahoney’s
        seminal study on publication bias (for which she got an NWO
        replication grant).
      abstract:
        title: Diving Into Metascience – Doing Research on Research
        content: Marjan Bakker will build her talk around the
          replication crisis in science. She will show examples of
          p-hacking and will discuss the surprising fraction of
          confirmed hypotheses. This is not only a problem in
          psychology attested by examples of failure to replicate
          studies in other fields. She pleads for preregistration of
          hypothesis, study-design, and analysis plan to minimize the
          researcher’s degrees of freedom
