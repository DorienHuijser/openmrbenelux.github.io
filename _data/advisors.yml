  bio: Natalia Bielczyk has a background in Physics,
    Mathematics and Psychology (3 x MSc), obtained at the
    College of Interfaculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural
    Sciences, University of Warsaw. She is now completing her
    thesis within the Donders Graduate School, Donders Institute
    for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the
    Netherlands. Her research concerns developing new methods
    for connectomics in the domain of cognitive neuroimaging,
    i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research.
    Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career
    Development and Mentoring Manager within the
    <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/">
    Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc
    Special Interest Group</a>,
    and serves as an eLife Associate within the

    eLife Ambassadors community</a>. In private, she is also a dedicated
    <a href="https://www.nataliabielczyk.com/">blogger</a>, and
    a speaker, giving workshops and talks about self-development
    in academia and transitions to industry. In November 2018,
    she founded Stichting Solaris Onderzoek en Ontwikkeling in a

  bio: Tim van Mourik is a PostDoc at the Donders Centre for
    Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis
    tools to analyse fMRI scans at an even finer level of
    detail, that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not
    only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals,
    but also applications to build graphical pipelines with
    these tools (<a href="https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/">
    Porcupine </a>). In addition, he set up web applications to facilitate
    sharing fMRI results in augmented reality
    (<a href="https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com">
    ARmadillo</a>) and improved collaboration on interactive workflows
    (<a href="https://giraffe.tools"> GiraffeTools </a>).
    At the OHBM conference 2019, Tim was the chair of the
    Open Science Room and in charge of organising a week long
    program with talks, discussions, and demos towards open and
    reproducible research practices.
