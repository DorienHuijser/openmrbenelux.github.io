  bio: Stephan is a researcher and PhD candidate at the Electrical Engineering
    Department of the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
    His research focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing
    methods for functional neuroimaging that allow the real-time tracking and
    visualisation of distributed MRI brain activity patterns. Stephan is
    passionate about making research and scientific practice more transparent,
    rigorous, and inclusive. He started the <a href="https://osceindhoven.github.io/">
    Open Science Community Eindhoven</a>, which is part of a wide Dutch network
    of researchers and university employees that focuses on improving scientific
    practice. He is also the founder of <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/">OpenMR
    Benelux</a>, a community working on wider adoption of open science principles
    in MRI research through talks, discussions, workshops, and hackathons.

  bio: Emanoel is a PhD researcher at the Erasmus Medical Center, in Rotterdam,
    The Netherlands. His research is focused on integrated methods for MR
    relaxometry and patient motion correction. Within the <a href="http://bigr.nl/">
    Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam</a>, he is involved in developing deep
    learning and analytical methods to reduce the influence motion corruption has in
    quantitative maps, increasing the reliability of estimation and patient comfort.
    He is one of the 15 early stage researchers of the B-Q Minded EU H2020 project which
    combines research, innovation, and education in the field of quantitative MRI.

  bio: Hannes is a PhD candidate at the Department of Data
    Analysis (Ghent University, Belgium). His main research
    interests concern functional and effective connectivity
    during task execution and resting state, in both a
    methodological and applied context. He is a passionate
    proponent of open science in general, with a specific
    interest in open analyses (e.g., computer code) and open
    data. He has been previously co-organizer of Brainhack Ghent
    2017 and 2018, and has given multiple talks on open science.

  bio: Sofie is currently doing a PhD at the Department of
    Data Analysis (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium), supervised
    by Prof. Dr. Daniele Marinazzo. Her research focuses on the
    intertwined domains of (resting-state) neuroscience and
    lateralization/handedness. During her PhD, she has also been
    involved in Open Science events, either as part of the
    organizing committee (BrainHack Ghent
    <a href="https://brainhackghent.wixsite.com/brainhackghent/submitted-projects">2017</a>
    <a href="https://brainhackghent.github.io/">2018</a> and
    <a href="http://www.brainhack.org/global2019/">Brainhack Global 2019</a>)
    or as a volunteer (e.g. Pint of Science, Ghent). Creating
    an Open Science community and communicating Open Science to
    a broader public is something she wants to be progressively
    involved in.

  bio: Remi is a postdoctoral fellow in the Crossmodal
    Perception and Plasticity laboratory (<a
    href="https://cpplab.be">CPP-Lab</a>)
    at the Université catholique de Louvain. His work focuses
    on the multisensory aspects of perception and he uses
    high-resolution MRI to address these questions. He sees in
    open science a way to a) build a more inclusive research
    community based on cooperation rather than competition and
    b) addresses some of the replicability and reproducibility
    issues that are affecting many areas of science.
