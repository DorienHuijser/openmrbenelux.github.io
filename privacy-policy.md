2.  <div style="text-align: justify">The summarized, anonymized statistics can also potentially be used to create open-access materials to be shared at our websites.

4.  <div style="text-align: justify">If you disclose personal information during a recorded meeting (e.g., via video or audio), we will try to make sure to delete those as much as possible before we make the recording publicly available. To prevent this from happening, we advise you to turn off your camera and microphone during such recordings. If you feel that we did not remove your personal details sufficiently, please reach out to us.</div>

<h2 style="color:#004777"> Whom we might share your information with? </h2>
<p><div style="text-align: justify">We do not share your information with any third parties. In case we would like to do this in the future, we will ask for your personal consent.</div></p>

If you request to become a member of our startup database, we will hold your contact information permanently until you request to remove the data from the database, or until the startup dissolves.
